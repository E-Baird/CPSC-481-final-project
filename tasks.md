# Intro to HCI Group 1
1. Your group identity (group name, any visual identity you've created for yourself like a logo)

2. The context of the application which includes:

    a. Where it will be used
    b. Who will be using it
    c. What they're currently doing to serve the functions of the application (a bit of competitive analysis should be done here)

3. One to two example tasks

    a. Be specific here. Identify your user(s) as specific people and present the task as if it were happening right now
    b. The tasks (as a reminder) should be described using the user's current technology and procedures. No mention of your application and how it will / might work should be included in the tasks.

4. Requirement lists created from the presented task examples. Show all the requirements you pulled from the task examples but you can focus discussion on a select few interesting or unexpected ones and detail:

    a. The requirement you included
    b. How it relates to the task example text
    c. What importance category you placed it into and why

## Group Info
Group Name:
- something with 'Makers'

Group Logo:
- ideas: gears, tools, lightbulbs, etc.

## Context
### Where it will be used:
- University of Calgary makerspace in TFDL

### Who will be using it:
- Students looking to use the space and the tools in it
    - use the tools for basic manufacturing or prototyping abilities for classes, startups, hobbies, etc
- Library staff who run the space

### What are they currently doing:

Students:
- currently everything is done either in person, or through the TFDL website: [U of C Makerspace](https://library.ucalgary.ca/makerspace_training/home)
    - it includes an overview of the space and the tools and some demos for each one
- currently tools such as the 3D printers can't be booked, so the site just tells users to arrive with plenty of time to spare
    - you also can't leave things printing overnight
- some tools such as full-service 3D printers have a cost for materials and machine setup. There is no information on the site about how to pay, so it is something that users have to ask about in person

## Tasks
1. Safety orientation/booking a class:
This task is something that would be done by any new user of the makerspace, as a safety orientation class is required for all new users. For existing makerspace users, the task of booking a class may come up whenever the space is offering specific programming that the user is interested in. For this reason, booking classes is a frequent and important task for all space users.
Joey wants to start using the makerspace. He goes to the TFDL webpage and reads the overview, and finds that there is a link to a safety orientation that all users must complete before they can use the space. He clicks the link and is taken to the TFDL's events calendar. He scrolls through the library's events, including lots that aren't related to the makerspace, and eventually finds a timeslot that works with his schedule. He fills out the form on the TFDL website with his name and email, and registers for the class. Joey is sent a confirmation email to tell him that he has successfully registered. If the class is online, the email includes a video conferencing link.
2. Requesting or showing interest in a demo or class: 
- TODO

3. Tool certification:

    The expected users of this task are the students, faculty and staff that want to use a tool available in the makerspace on their own and have not yet receive a certification badge on said tool. The tools that require a badge include the 3D printer, Carvey CNC Milling Machine, Raspberry Pis, the Embroidery Machine, and Arduino Microcontrollers. Other services like the Cricut and the Laser Cutter do not require a badge or are available for full serve only.
    This is a task of great importance since without a certification badge the user cannot access certain tools in the makerspace. Certifications help the staff at the TFDL makerspace make sure that the users know how to manipulate the tools safely.
    Brian wants to use a specific tool from the makerspace, in this case the 3D printer. He needs to get certified in order to use it. He goes to the makerspace webpage (https://library.ucalgary.ca/makerspace/) and hovering over the 3D printing image he clicks on "Learn more about DIY printing". He then decides he will use the 3D printer without support so he clicks on the "Self Serve 3D Printing" tab. He must read the information displayed which includes instructions on the basic funcionality of the 3D printer and useful information for users. Then he must complete a quiz by clicking on the "3D Printing Quiz" link at the bottom of the page. After answering all the questions on the quiz he should enter his name and email address. Since Brian has answered more than 75% of the quiz questions correctly, he receives an email with his digital badge. This badge is a digital icon with information about when and how it was acquired. Brian can then use the email to view the badge or login at https://badges.ucalgary.ca/ to view all his badges. With this badge he will be able to use the Self Serve 3D Printer service at the TFDL makerspace.

5. Booking time on a machine:
This task is something that would be done by a makerspace user who has already been certified to work on a machine. It is especially impactful for people using a machine that potentially takes a lot of time to setup and run, such as a 3D printer, but it is something that is done by all users. The act of figuring out if a machine is available and claiming it is probably the most common task for users, other than the tasks of physically using a machine. For this reason, booking time on a machine is frequent and important for all space users.
Joey wants to print a case for his personal Raspberry Pi. He has already found a good model on the internet and is ready to go to the makerspace and start the machine. He wants some finer-grained control than what he would get from the space's full-service print job, so he decides to do a self-serve print. He goes to the TFDL website to see if there is any way to tell if the machine is in use, down for maintenance, or available, but isn't able to find anything. He decides that he'll just have to go down to the space to check for himself. When he gets there, he learns that someone else is using the printer and he'll have to wait for around 20 minutes for them to be done, so he goes back to the first floor of the library to grab a coffee and wait. After he finishes his coffee, Joey goes back upstairs to the makerspace, only to find that someone else has snagged the 3D printer while he was away. This time, Joey sits in the space on his phone, waiting for the machine to be free. Finally, the other user finishes up and Joey can start his print job.
The website just says to show up with plenty of time to spare


6. Live queue and space usage updates:

    The expected users that fall under this task include anyone waiting to get their hands on a piece of equipment. This task is quite important as there is of course a limited supply of all the tools, so students will have the share the equipment with other students, preferably on a first come first serve basis. When all of the equipment is being used, students will want to know the approximate wait time until they have access to the tools they are looking to make use of. Having a live queue allows them to at least know that all of the equipment is currently unavailable, if not when it will be available, making this task fall under the "should be included" and "frequently done and important" categories. The only reason we did not put this in the must do category is because without a live queue, they are still able to accomplish the absolutely necessary task of using the equipment, even if it may be inconvenient not knowing when. The current state of this tasks is asking the school staff about any availability and it being communicated through word of mouth. If the equipment is being used, then you are simply unable to book it for your preferred time.

7. Report a problem:

    The expected user will be anyone who is currently using the machines and have encountered a problem while working on their project. Should the user encounter any problems when they are working on the machines, they should be able to ask for assistance from someone who has more knowledge of how the machines work such as staff members. This task is considered “out of scope” and is excluded since there will always be supervising staff on the site during open hours. User’s should be able to easily locate staff themselves without using the app.
    While working on their project, Joey encounters a problem with the machine and does not know how to fix it. As there is always staff on site supervising the makerspace, Joey asks for help from the staff. If the problem is fixable, then Joey can continue on his work after the staff is finished. Otherwise, Joey may have to work on his project on the other machine if there is one. If there is no second machine, then Joey will have to come back another time. 


### How the Tasks were collected

We chose these 7 tasks by envisioning ourselves as students looking to use the school's makerspace and chronologically going through the feature we feel are essential in maker our user experience as smooth as possible. By thinking about the tasks in chronological order, we are able to identity in-between tasks more effectively as we see them to be essential steps towards the next task. Some of our team members have used makerspaces before, so we used their opinions to validate our choices of tasks. After choosing the tasks in chronological order, we organized them in terms of importance, starting with the most essential tasks being anything to do with booking, seeing as that is usually the purpose of any management app. The should do category was filled with things that would be extremely inconvenient not do have, but the equipment can still be used without. This includes requesting a class when there are none available and being able to see a live queue of what equipment is currently in use by others. The "could do" category includes tasks that wouldn't be too difficult to implement, but are fine in their current such as changing the current system of how student receive their badges confirming their qualifications to use a piece of equipment. Finally, the out of scope tasks included non-essential idea that would take a lot of time to program, such as creating virtual certification classes for each tool and giving the students the ability to report a detailed problem using the app.

## Requirement List

### Must Do:
- Booking a class:

    Classes are used to ensure that students have the necessary qualifications to operate the expensive equipment. Orientation classes are also required for any new users who want to be able to access the space. We chose to put this task in the "must do" category for a few reasons. First, because of the orientation class, this task is something that every single user of the space will do at least once. Second, there is limited staff in the TFDL, so students are required to reserve spots in these classes, and some form of booking management is required, but the existing booking management system is pretty lacking. There is no easy way for users to figure out what classes are necessary for which parts of the space, beyond just reading a wall of text on the TFDL website, and when they do decide on what to sign up for, users are simply told to scan through the complete list of programming going on at TFDL, almost all of which is irrelevant to Makerspace users. Because of the critical nature of the task, and the fact that it really needs an overhaul, the ability to book a class is something that we categorized as a "must do."
    
- Booking time on a machine: 

    The Makerspace has limited machines, and some of them such as the 3D printers or CNC router can take a long time to complete a job. Because of this, it is very possible for a user to show up to the space simply to find that there is no available time on a machine. Currently, there is no system in place for booking a timeslot on a machine, and the TFDL website simply states, "3D printers are not bookable, so arrive with sufficient time.  Remember, you get a time estimate when you slice a model in PrusaSlicer. Add 10% to this estimate to ensure your print will be done before Lab NEXT closes, as we do not allow prints to run overnight."
    As we stated in "booking a class", booking is an essential task for management apps and being able to book when you use the equipment is the primary function of our management app. This would arguably make this one of the most important tasks on our list, so it falls under "must do"  

### Should Do:
- Requesting a class

    Being able to request a class to learn how to use a tool when there are no classes being offered is a really nice feature to have for a few reasons. The biggest of these is that, like booking time on a machine, this task is currently really poorly served. If no courses or orientations are currently scheduled on the TFDL's general programming calendar, as a user it is really difficult to figure out what your next steps should be. It is doable, but even without this feature, students will still be able to access classes when they are available. That is why this falls into "should do" and not "must have."

- Live queue/space updates

    A live queue is also a nice to have. Similar to the two above tasks, this is something that has no formal sytem available to help users complete the task. There are many forms that this task could take in our system, but in general it will tell students how long they will have to wait before being able to use the first available piece of equipment or their interest. The reason we did not put this in the must do category is because without a live queue, they are still able to accomplish the absolutely necessary task of using the equipment, even if it may be inconvenient not knowing when. Even though this task is less common or impactful than other tasks, depending on the implementation we can cover this task mostly 'for free' because it shares features with the 'Requesting a Machine' task. For this reason, it makes sense to get a lot of bang for our buck by including it. We believe that makes it fall under the "should do" category. 

### Could Do:
- Badge acquisition: 

    Currently, the TFDL makerspace issues access cards to users who have completed their orientation training. We could see implementations where these cards could be integrated with our system, such as through a QR code, but overall it seems that the current access system works quite well for users and it seems excessive to completely overhaul it without good reason. Because of this, we decided that this task should be categorized as "could do." 

### Out of Scope:
- Tool certification: 
    The system for getting trained on tools is currently done via a combination of online and in person training. Even though the process of getting certified on machines is a task that all users have to go through, it is a one-time process for each tool. This means that it is less general-purpose than some other tasks such as booking a class, which users can potentially do repeatedly depending on what programming is being offered. Additionally, this task is very different from any of the others, so attempting to include it would cause the project complexity to vastly increase.

- Report a problem: 
    There is always a staff member at the makerspace during open hours, but even if there was a time when no one was around, other library staff are also available to help. Supporting this task might make more sense if we were targeting library staff as our main user group, as they are the ones who have to deal with and catalog the problem. However, because our main users are students who work in the space, we decided that this task was well covered by existing systems and was therefore out of scope.
