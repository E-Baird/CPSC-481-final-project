# Intro to HCI Group 1
1. Your group identity (group name, any visual identity you've created for yourself like a logo)

2. The context of the application which includes:

    a. Where it will be used
    b. Who will be using it
    c. What they're currently doing to serve the functions of the application (a bit of competitive analysis should be done here)

3. One to two example tasks

    a. Be specific here. Identify your user(s) as specific people and present the task as if it were happening right now
    b. The tasks (as a reminder) should be described using the user's current technology and procedures. No mention of your application and how it will / might work should be included in the tasks.

4. Requirement lists created from the presented task examples. Show all the requirements you pulled from the task examples but you can focus discussion on a select few interesting or unexpected ones and detail:

    a. The requirement you included
    b. How it relates to the task example text
    c. What importance category you placed it into and why

## Group Info
Group Name:
- something with 'Makers'

Group Logo:
- ideas: gears, tools, lightbulbs, etc.

## Context
### Where it will be used:
- University of Calgary makerspace in TFDL

### Who will be using it:
- Students looking to use the space and the tools in it
    - use the tools for basic manufacturing or prototyping abilities for classes, startups, hobbies, etc
- Library staff who run the space

### What are they currently doing:

Students:
- currently everything is done through the TFDL website: [U of C Makerspace](https://library.ucalgary.ca/makerspace_training/home)
    - it includes an overview of the space and the tools and some demos for each one
- currently tools such as the 3D printers can't be booked, so the site just tells users to arrive with plenty of time to spare
    - you also can't leave things printing overnight
- some tools such as full-service 3D printers have a cost for materials and machine setup. There is no information on the site about how to pay, so it is something that users have to ask about in person

## Tasks
1. Safety orientation/booking a class:
- Joey wants to start using the makerspace. He goes to the TFDL webpage and reads the overview, and finds that there is a link to a safety orientation that all users must complete before they can use the space. He clicks the link and is taken to the TFDL's events calendar. He scrolls through the library's events, including lots that aren't related to the makerspace, and finds a timeslot.
2. Requesting or showing interest in a demo or class: 
- TODO
3. Tool certification:
- The library website has quizzes which test your knowledge about the basic functionality of a machine. 
    - question: How do they actually tell if you have completed your safety quiz? Does it go on your student record?
4. Badge:
- Looks like it's a physical badge that is issued to the user once they have successfully completed the quiz and filled out their contact info.
5. Booking time on a machine:
- Currently the U of C's Makerspace has no way to prebook time on machines. The website just says to show up with plenty of time to spare

6. Live queue and space usage updates:

    The expected users that fall under this task include anyone waiting to get their hands on a piece of equipment. This task is quite important as there is of course a limited supply of all the tools, so students will have the share the equipment with other students, preferably on a first come first serve basis. When all of the equipment is being used, students will want to know the approximate wait time until they have access to the tools they are looking to make use of. Having a live queue allows them to at least know that all of the equipment is currently unavailable, if not when it will be available, making this task fall under the "should be included" and "frequently done and important" categories. The only reason we did not put this in the must do category is because without a live queue, they are still able to accomplish the absolutely necessary task of using the equipment, even if it may be inconvenient not knowing when. The current state of this tasks is asking the school staff about any availability and it being communicated through word of mouth. If the equipment is being used, then you are simply unable to book it for your preferred time.

7. Report a problem:
- Talk to the person on staff and let them know that there's a problem

### How the Tasks were collected

    We chose these 7 tasks by envisioning ourselves as students looking to use the school's makerspace and chronologically going through the feature we feel are essential in maker our user experience as smooth as possible. By thinking about the tasks in chronological order, we are able to identity in-between tasks more effectively as we see them to be essential steps towards the next task. Some of our team members have used makerspaces before, so we used their opinions to validate our choices of tasks. After choosing the tasks in chronological order, we organized them in terms of importance, starting with the most essential tasks being anything to do with booking, seeing as that is usually the purpose of any management app. The should do category was filled with things that would be extremely inconvenient not do have, but the equipment can still be used without. This includes requesting a class when there are none available and being able to see a live queue of what equipment is currently in use by others. The "could do" category includes tasks that wouldn't be too difficult to implement, but are fine in their current such as changing the current system of how student receive their badges confirming their qualifications to use a piece of equipment. Finally, the out of scope tasks included non-essential idea that would take a lot of time to program, such as creating virtual certification classes for each tool and giving the students the ability to report a detailed problem using the app.

## Requirement List

### Must Do:
- Booking a class:

    Classes are used to ensure that students have the necessary qualifications to operate the expensive 
equipment. They must be held before a student can use any of the tools in the makerspace alone. Seeing as there is limited staff in TFDL, students would have to book to reserve a spot in one of these classes. Seeing as most management apps are expected to have a booking feature, we feel that this task is absolutely essential and should fall under the "must do" category.
    
- Booking time on a machine: 

    As we stated in "booking a class", booking is an essential task for management apps and being able to  book when you use the equipment is the primary function of our management app. This would arguably make    this into our most important task, so it falls under "must do"  

### Should Do:
- Requesting a class

    Being able to request a class to learn how to use a tool when there are no classes being offered is a really nice feature to have because it tells the makerspace that there are students looking to use the equipment who need to be helped. It is doable, but even without this feature, students will still be able to access classes when they are available. That is why this falls into "should do" and not "must have".

- Live queue/space updates

    A live queue is also a nice to have as it will tell students how long they will have to wait before being able to use the first available piece of equipment or their interest. We believe that makes it fall under the "should do" category. The only reason we did not put this in the must do category is because without a live queue, they are still able to accomplish the absolutely necessary task of using the equipment, even if it may be inconvenient not knowing when.

### Could Do:
- Badge acquisition: we think the physical badge is fine as-is, but we could also see it working as part of your student ID or a QR code on an app

### Out of Scope:
- Tool certification: this should probably be done in person
- Report a problem: there's always a staff member at the space, so it should be fine to leave this one out of the requirements for the app.

## Other junk
- collaboration ideas - ability to have a display somewhere that states what you're working on
