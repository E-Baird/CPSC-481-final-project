# Intro to HCI Group 1
1. Your group identity (group name, any visual identity you've created for yourself like a logo)

2. The context of the application which includes:

    a. Where it will be used
    b. Who will be using it
    c. What they're currently doing to serve the functions of the application (a bit of competitive analysis should be done here)

3. One to two example tasks

    a. Be specific here. Identify your user(s) as specific people and present the task as if it were happening right now
    b. The tasks (as a reminder) should be described using the user's current technology and procedures. No mention of your application and how it will / might work should be included in the tasks.

4. Requirement lists created from the presented task examples. Show all the requirements you pulled from the task examples but you can focus discussion on a select few interesting or unexpected ones and detail:

    a. The requirement you included
    b. How it relates to the task example text
    c. What importance category you placed it into and why

## Group Info
Group Name:
- something with 'Makers'

Group Logo:
- ideas: gears, tools, lightbulbs, etc.

## Context
### Where it will be used:
- University of Calgary makerspace in TFDL

### Who will be using it:
- Students looking to use the space and the tools in it
    - use the tools for basic manufacturing or prototyping abilities for classes, startups, hobbies, etc
- Library staff who run the space

### What are they currently doing:

Students:
- currently everything is done through the TFDL website: [U of C Makerspace](https://library.ucalgary.ca/makerspace_training/home)
    - it includes an overview of the space and the tools and some demos for each one
- currently tools such as the 3D printers can't be booked, so the site just tells users to arrive with plenty of time to spare
    - you also can't leave things printing overnight
- some tools such as full-service 3D printers have a cost for materials and machine setup. There is no information on the site about how to pay, so it is something that users have to ask about in person

## Tasks
1. Safety orientation/booking a class:
- Joey wants to start using the makerspace. He goes to the TFDL webpage and reads the overview, and finds that there is a link to a safety orientation that all users must complete before they can use the space. He clicks the link and is taken to the TFDL's events calendar. He scrolls through the library's events, including lots that aren't related to the makerspace, and finds a timeslot.
2. Requesting or showing interest in a demo or class: 
- TODO
3. Tool certification:
- The library website has quizzes which test your knowledge about the basic functionality of a machine. 
    - question: How do they actually tell if you have completed your safety quiz? Does it go on your student record?
4. Badge:
- Looks like it's a physical badge that is issued to the user once they have successfully completed the quiz and filled out their contact info.
5. Booking time on a machine:
- Currently the U of C's Makerspace has no way to prebook time on machines. The website just says to show up with plenty of time to spare
6. Live queue and space usage updates:
- Go to the makerspace and look in the window.
7. Report a problem:
- Talk to the person on staff and let them know that there's a problem

## Requirement List

### Must Do:
- Booking a class
- Booking time on a machine: this is currently missing from the TFDL's makerspace and it's a huge missed opportunity

### Should Do:
- Requesting a class
- Live queue/space updates

### Could Do:
- Badge acquisition: we think the physical badge is fine as-is, but we could also see it working as part of your student ID or a QR code on an app

### Out of Scope:
- Tool certification: this should probably be done in person
- Report a problem: there's always a staff member at the space, so it should be fine to leave this one out of the requirements for the app.

## Other junk
- collaboration ideas - ability to have a display somewhere that states what you're working on
